# CPU Scheduling Simulator (Web-Based)

This project is developed by **Sumayah Lateef** as a practical implementation of Operating System scheduling algorithms.  
It allows users to input processes and simulate scheduling using different algorithms with a visual Gantt chart.

## 🔍 **Implemented Algorithms**
| Algorithm | Type |
|----------|------|
| FCFS | Non-preemptive |
| SJF | Non-preemptive |
| Priority Scheduling | Non-preemptive |
| Round Robin | Preemptive (time quantum based) |

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **HTML** – UI Structure  
- **CSS** – Styling & layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic & algorithm implementation  

No backend or framework required — runs fully in browser.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- Add processes dynamically (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time)
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms
- Outputs:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Execution Order (Timeline)
  - Gantt Chart visualization
- Fully interactive UI
- Reset functionality to re-simulate
